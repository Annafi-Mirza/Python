This is an early (CS, not DS) project of mine that was completed 
before I completely entered college.

I used the Replit IDE to create this. As such, to guarantee that
it works, I recommend creating a "Tkinter" Repl on Replit and
importing the main.py file from here to ensure that it fully 
works.

This project utilizes Tkinter for a GUI. It has 4 main functions:
1. Create a random password with however many letters, numbers,
and symbols you want in it.
2. Input a password and detect how weak or strong it is based on
its characteristics, like how many uppercase letters or symbols
it contains.
3. Input a message and a shift value and receive its form
encrypted with a Caesar cypher. Input a Caesar-encrypted form
and its corresponding shift value to get the message back.
4. Translate text to binary.

This project was mainly for the purpose of discovering how to
develop GUIs with Python.
